you can evaluate astuation by compating one vlue in the script to what you expect it might be.the result will be Boolean: true or false.
**we can use these code in javascript to comparison:**
* **==** (this operator compares tow values to see if they are the same)
* **!=** (this operator compares tow values to see if they are not the same)
* **===** (this operator compares tow values to cheack that both the data type and value  are the same)
* **!==**  (this operator compares tow values to cheack that both the data type and value  are not the same)
* **>** (this operator cheacks if the number in the lift is greater than the number in the right)
* **<** (this operator cheacks if the number in the lift is less than the number in the right)
 **>=** (this operator cheacks if the number in the lift is  greater or equal than the number in the right)
* **<=** (this operator cheacks if the number in the lift is less or equal than the number in the right)

**we can use these code in javascript to make logical operators:**
* **&&** logical _AND_
* **||** logical _OR_
* **!** logical _NOT_
# LOOPS in javascript
loops cheack condition if it returns true a code block will run the the condition will be cheacked agian and if it still returns true the code block will run again.
**there are three common types of loops:**
* **FOR** if you want to run code a specific number of time.
* **WHILE** if you dont know many time the code should run.
