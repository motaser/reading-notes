# Images
There are several things to consider when selecting and
preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them
right will make it look more attractive and professional.
In this chapter you will learn how to:

* nclude an image in your web pages using HTML.
* Pick which image format to use.
* Show an image at the right size.
* Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages
load faste.

** Adding Images**

**_<img>_**
 To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag).

_height_
This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
_width_ 
This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

**_<figure>_**
Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new <figure> element to contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.

1. The <img> element is used to add images to a
web page.
2.  You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.
3. You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
4.  Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

# Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

**RGB values**

These express colors in terms of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

**Hex codes** 

These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

**color names**

There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized
by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.


# Text
The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:

* Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,and the size of the text)
* Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)

1. There are properties to control t XX he choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
2.  There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
3. If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
4.  You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
5.  You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
