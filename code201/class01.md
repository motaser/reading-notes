# How the Web Works
When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

* HTML  ages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
# Extra Markup
Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML.
* HTML 4
* HTML 5
* XHTML 1.0
SO we can summaries extra markup by this points:
DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
## HTML5 Layout

The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
## Process & Design
It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
 ;Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
 Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page; Design is about communication. Vi
