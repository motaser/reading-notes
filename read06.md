# Javascript
*** javascriprt its a programming language which it allows you to mack web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the contant.***
**_What is the script and how i do creat one?_**
 script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
 * A script is a series of instructions that the computer 
can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of 
all the instructions. 
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than 
humans, so your instructions must let the computer 
solve the task prggrammatically. 
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help)
## EXPRESSIONS and OPERATION
_An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions._
* EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A 
VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be 
given a value. As you have seen, this is done using 
the assignment operator (the equals sign). 
* EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR 
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A 
SINGLE VALUE 
You can perform operations on any number of 
individual values (see next page) to determine a 
single value.
_Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to 
create a single value from one or more values._
* ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS Assign a value to a variable 
color = 'beige'; 
* ARITHMETIC OPERATORS Perform basic math 
area = 3 * 2;
* STRING OPERATORS Combine two strings 
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly'; 
* COMPARISON OPERATORS Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se 
buy = 3 > 5;
* LOGICAL OPERATORS Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se 
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); 
## Function on Javascript
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
_for example:_ 
**function updateMessage() { 
var el = document.getElementByld('message'}; 
el .textContent = msg; 
}**
1. The function can store the instruction for a specific task.
2. when you need the script to perform the task you call the function 
3. the function executes the code in the ode block
4. when it has finished the code continuesto run from the point where it was initially called
