# Mastering Markdown
my name is montaser araidah and i am taking alisons in software devloper and we will talk about mastering markdown.
**mastering markdown** is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
## Syntax guide
1. Headers # This is an <h1> tag
2. Emphasis *This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
3. Lists * Item 1
4. Images
