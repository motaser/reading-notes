# COLOR IN CSS
## Foreground Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. Rgb values
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
2. Hex codes
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80
3. color names
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: DarkCyan
## Background Color
You can specify your choice of background color in the same 
three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, 
hex codes, and color names (covered on the next page).
For example body {background-color: rgb(200,200,200);}

when picking foreground and background 
colors, it is important to ensure that there is 
enough contrast for the text to be legible.
* _low contrast_ :Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors
* _high contrast_:ext is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
* _mideum contrast_:For long spans of text, reducing 
the contrast a little bit improves readability.

indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA**.

with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA**.
