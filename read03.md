is, why they would come to your site, what information 
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

will need to go on each page.

visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

## HTML5 Layout 
TML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
* <heder> <footer>
theseelements can be used for:The main header or footer 
that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page
* <nav>
The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational 
blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
* <artical>
he <article> element acts as a container for any section of  page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content
* <aside>
When the <aside> element is used inside an <article>element, it should contain information that is related to the 
article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be 
considered as an aside to the article it relates to.
* <artical>
*<div>
 <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through 
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of 
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special 
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
